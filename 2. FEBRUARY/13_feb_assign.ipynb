    "In Python, all built-in exceptions (such as TypeError, ValueError, IndexError, etc.) are subclasses of the Exception class, which itself is a subclass of the BaseException class.

    "Additionally, when you inherit from the Exception class, you can override the __str__ method to provide more informative error messages when the exception is raised.

    "some best practices for exception handling in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "Handle only the exceptions that you are expecting: Always try to catch only the exceptions that you are expecting and handle them in the most appropriate way. Do not catch all exceptions using a generic except block as it may hide some unexpected errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use multiple except blocks to handle different types of exceptions: Use separate except blocks to handle different types of exceptions. This will make your code more readable and easier to understand.\n",
    "\n",
    "Be specific when catching exceptions: When catching an exception, be specific about the type of exception that you are catching. For example, if you are expecting a ValueError, catch only that exception and not a more generic Exception class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use finally block to release resources: Use the finally block to release any resources that your code has acquired, such as files or network connections. The finally block is executed whether or not an exception is thrown, so it is a good place to put any cleanup code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use the with statement to automatically close files: When working with files, use the with statement to ensure that the file is automatically closed when the block is exited. This can help avoid issues like forgetting to close a file or a file remaining open if an exception is raised.\n",
    "\n",
    "Log errors: Always log any errors that occur so that you can easily trace and debug the issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "Raise exceptions sparingly: Raise exceptions only when necessary, i.e., when the code cannot recover from the error. In other cases, you can return an error code or use a default value to handle the error condition.\n",
    "\n",
    "Keep your code concise: Write concise and readable code that is easy to understand and maintain. Avoid nesting too many try-except blocks or too many if-else conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Test your code thoroughly: Write test cases that cover all possible scenarios and edge cases to ensure that your code is robust and handles all possible exceptions."
