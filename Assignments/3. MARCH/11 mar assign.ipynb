    "The main differences between a t-test and a z-test are related to the assumptions they make and the scenarios in which they are used. Here's a concise comparison of the two:\n",
    "\n",
    "**T-Test**:\n",
    "1. **Assumptions**: The t-test assumes that the population standard deviation (\\(\\sigma\\)) is unknown and must be estimated from the sample. It also assumes that the data follows a normal distribution.\n",
    "2. **Sample Size**: T-tests are suitable for both small and larger sample sizes (\\(n\\)). They are particularly useful for small sample sizes (\\(n < 30\\)) when the population standard deviation is unknown.\n",
    "3. **Distribution**: The t-test uses the t-distribution, which has heavier tails than the standard normal (z) distribution. The t-distribution becomes more similar to the z-distribution as the sample size increases.\n",
    "4. **Applications**: T-tests are used for hypothesis testing and confidence interval estimation involving population means when the population standard deviation is unknown or when the sample size is small.\n",
    "5. **Variants**: There are different types of t-tests, including one-sample t-test, independent two-sample t-test, and paired two-sample t-test.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Z-Test**:\n",
    "1. **Assumptions**: The z-test assumes that the population standard deviation (\\(\\sigma\\)) is known or that the sample size is large (\\(n \\geq 30\\)) such that the sample mean's distribution is approximately normal.\n",
    "2. **Sample Size**: Z-tests are suitable for larger sample sizes (\\(n \\geq 30\\)) when the population standard deviation is known.\n",
    "3. **Distribution**: The z-test uses the standard normal (z) distribution, which has a known shape and characteristics.\n",
    "4. **Applications**: Z-tests are used for hypothesis testing and confidence interval estimation involving population means when the population standard deviation is known and the sample size is large.\n",
    "5. **Usage**: Z-tests are used less frequently in practice due to the requirement of knowing the population standard deviation.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the choice between a t-test and a z-test depends on factors such as the sample size and whether the population standard deviation is known. If the population standard deviation is known and the sample size is large, a z-test is appropriate. If the population standard deviation is unknown or the sample size is small, a t-test is more suitable due to its ability to account for these uncertainties."
