    "Bayes' theorem and conditional probability are closely related concepts in probability theory. Bayes' theorem can be derived from conditional probability, and they both involve understanding the likelihood of events based on certain conditions. Here's the relationship between the two:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conditional Probability**: Conditional probability refers to the probability of an event A occurring given that another event B has already occurred. It's denoted as \\( P(A|B) \\), which is read as \"the probability of A given B.\"\n",

    "**Bayes' Theorem**: Bayes' theorem is a formula that provides a way to calculate the conditional probability of an event A occurring given that another event B has occurred, based on prior knowledge or information. It's expressed as:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[ P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) \\]\n",

    "- \\( P(A) \\) is the prior probability of event A.\n",
    "- \\( P(B) \\) is the evidence probability of event B.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Relationship**: Bayes' theorem provides a systematic way to update our beliefs about the likelihood of event A occurring based on new evidence (the likelihood \\( P(B|A) \\)) and the prior knowledge we have about event A (\\( P(A) \\)). It's a way of reversing the conditioning: instead of just calculating \\( P(A|B) \\) directly, which might be difficult, we calculate it using \\( P(B|A) \\), \\( P(A) \\), and \\( P(B) \\). This is why Bayes' theorem is also known as the \"law of inverse probability.\"\n",
