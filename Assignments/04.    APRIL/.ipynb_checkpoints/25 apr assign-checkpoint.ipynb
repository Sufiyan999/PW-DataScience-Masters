    "1. **Eigenvectors:** Geometrically, an eigenvector of a matrix represents a direction in space that remains unchanged (or gets scaled) when the matrix is applied to it.

Eigenvectors represent these special directions that are unaffected or scaled by the transformation, while eigenvalues represent the degree of scaling along those directions. This interpretation is valuable in various applications, such as understanding the behavior of physical systems, image compression, and dimensionality reduction techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA)."
