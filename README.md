## Installation Instructions

Follow these steps to set up your environment and install the required packages:

1. **Create a Virtual Environment:**

   Before we start, it's a good idea to create a virtual environment to isolate this project's dependencies. Open your terminal and navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd path/to/your/project
   python -m venv venv
   ```

   Replace `path/to/your/project` with the actual path to your project directory.

2. **Install Python >= 3.10:**

   In this step, we'll use `pip` to install Python >= 3.10 into your virtual environment. Activate your virtual environment:

   On Windows (using Command Prompt or PowerShell):
   ```bash
   venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

   On macOS and Linux:
   ```bash
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

   Now, use `pip` to install Python 3.10 or a higher version:

   ```bash
   pip install python>=3.10
   ```

   After the installation is complete, verify the installed Python version:

   ```bash
   python --version
   ```

   This should display a version equal to or greater than 3.10, confirming that you have the required Python version.

3. **Install Project Dependencies:**

   With the correct Python version installed, you're ready to install the project dependencies from the `requirements.txt` file:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   This command will install all the necessary packages and their compatible versions.

4. **You're Ready to Go:**

   Congratulations! You've successfully set up your environment and installed the required packages. You're all set to explore and learn.

###    Important  Notice   :  Updates  To  Course  Curriculum  Schedule

We would like to inform all participants that there have been changes made to certain topics and their corresponding dates in the course lCurriculum  schedule. These adjustments were made due to technical reasons in order to enhance the overall learning experience.

We understand the significance of a well-structured curriculum and have taken these changes seriously to ensure the course's effectiveness.

Thank you for your cooperation and adaptability as we strive to deliver a seamless learning journey.


## An Important Message for PW Skills - Data Science Masters and Full Stack Data Science Pro Batch Students 

### Collaborative Learning and Resource Sharing Opportunity


Hello fellow participants of the  Data Science Masters Impact batch and  Full Stack Data Science Pro Batch Students,

I hope you're all enjoying the learning journey as much as I am! As we navigate through the course material, assignments, and projects, I wanted to propose a collaborative initiative that could greatly benefit everyone in the cohort.

I have set up a Git repository where I'm organizing my lecture notes, assignments, and any supplementary materials that I find useful. This has proven to be an effective way of staying organized and ensuring that I have easy access to all the resources I need.

I encourage each of you to consider doing the same. By maintaining individual repositories and sharing your hand written  notes, code, assignments , and projects  we can create a robust network of learning resources. This will not only help us grasp the course concepts better but also foster a strong sense of community and support among us.

### How to Contribute:

1. **Create Your Repository:** Start by setting up your own Git repository to host your notes, assignments, and any other relevant content.

2. **Structure Your Repo:** To make navigation easier for others, follow a clear directory structure and naming conventions. A `readme.md` file at the root of your repository can serve as a guide on how to explore your content.

3. **Share Your Link:** Once you have your repository set up, share the link with me via [mail](sufiyabusy@gmail.com) or Send me a DM on [Discord](https://discord.com/users/sufiyan5382) or [Telegrame](https://t.me/MohSufiyan)  .  I'll compile a list of all the repositories and add them to my `readme.md` file for easy reference.or you can add it by just pull  and push request .

By collaborating in this manner, we can create a valuable resource hub that benefits not only our classmates but also students from future course cohorts or even individuals outside our course who are interested in learning these topics.
