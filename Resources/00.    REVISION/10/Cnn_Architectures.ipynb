    ">AlexNet was designed by Hinton, winner of the 2012 ImageNet competition, and his student Alex Krizhevsky. It was also after that year that more and deeper neural networks were proposed, such as the excellent vgg, GoogleLeNet. Its official data model has an accuracy rate of 57.1% and top 1-5 reaches 80.2%. This is already quite outstanding for traditional machine learning classification algorithms.\n",

    "ReLU-based deep convolutional networks are trained several times faster than tanh and sigmoid- based networks. The following figure shows the number of iterations for a four-layer convolutional network based on CIFAR-10 that reached 25% training error in tanh and ReLU:\n",
    "\n",
    "![alex1](img/alex612.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Standardization ( Local Response Normalization )**\n",
    "\n",
    "After using ReLU f (x) = max (0, x), you will find that the value after the activation function has no range like the tanh and sigmoid functions, so a normalization will usually be done after ReLU, and the LRU is a steady proposal (Not sure here, it should be proposed?) One method in neuroscience is called \"Lateral inhibition\", which talks about the effect of active neurons on its surrounding neurons.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Dropout**\n",
    "\n",
    "Dropout is also a concept often said, which can effectively prevent overfitting of neural networks. Compared to the general linear model, a regular method is used to prevent the model from overfitting. In the neural network, Dropout is implemented by modifying the structure of the neural network itself. For a certain layer of neurons, randomly delete some neurons with a defined probability, while keeping the individuals of the input layer and output layer neurons unchanged, and then update the parameters according to the learning method of the neural network. In the next iteration, rerandom Remove some neurons until the end of training.\n",

    "\n",
    ">Â  RegularizationââThe relatively small amount of data will cause the model to overfit, making the training error small and the test error particularly large. By adding a regular term after the Loss Function , the overfitting can be suppressed. The disadvantage is that a need is introduced Manually adjusted hyper-parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    ">Â  Dropout- also a regularization method. But different from the above, it is achieved by randomly setting the output of some neurons to zero\n",
    "\n",

    "This architecture is a landmark in the development of deep network models . The most prominent contribution is to propose a normalized Batch Normalization layer to unify the output range of the network. It is fixed in a relatively uniform range. If the BN layer is not added, the value range of the network input and output of each layer is greatly different, so the size of the learning rate will be different. The BN layer avoids this situation This accelerates the training of the network and gives the network regular terms to a certain extent , reducing the degree of overfitting of the network. In the subsequent development of network models, most models have more or less added BN layers to the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this paper, the BN layer is standardized before being input to the activation function. At the same time, VGG uses 2 3x3 convs instead of 5x5 convs in the inception module to reduce the amount of parameters and speed up the calculation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Algorithm advantages:\n",
    "1. **Improved learning rate** : In the BN model, a higher learning rate is used to accelerate training convergence, but it will not cause other effects. Because if the scale of each layer is different, then the learning rate required by each layer is different. The scale of the same layer dimension often also needs different learning rates. Usually, the minimum learning is required to ensure the loss function to decrease, but The BN layer keeps the scale of each layer and dimension consistent, so you can directly use a higher learning rate for optimization.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Remove the dropout layer** : The BN layer makes full use of the goals of the dropout layer. Remove the dropout layer from the BN-Inception model, but no overfitting will occur.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Decrease the attenuation coefficient of L2 weight** : Although the L2 loss controls the overfitting of the Inception model, the loss of weight has been reduced by five times in the BN-Inception model.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Accelerate the decay of the learning rate** : When training the Inception model, we let the learning rate decrease exponentially. Because our network is faster than Inception, we will increase the speed of reducing the learning rate by 6 times.\n",

    "6. **Scramble training samples more thoroughly** : We scramble training samples, which can prevent the same samples from appearing in a mini-batch. This can improve the accuracy of the validation set by 1%, which is the advantage of the BN layer as a regular term. In our method, random selection is more effective when the model sees different samples each time.\n",

    "1.  **Prevent bottlenecks in characterization** . The so-called bottleneck of feature description is that a large proportion of features are compressed in the middle layer (such as using a pooling operation). This operation will cause the loss of feature space information and the loss of features. Although the operation of pooling in CNN is important, there are some methods that can be used to avoid this loss as much as possible (I note: later hole convolution operations ).\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **The higher the dimensionality of the feature, the faster the training converges** . That is, the independence of features has a great relationship with the speed of model convergence.

Hebbin principle : fire together, wire together.\n",

Even if the dimensions are reduced, the correlation can still be used to restore its original information.\n",

Therefore, we can reduce their activation values ââbefore aggregation , which should generate similar local expression descriptions.\n",
    "\n",

Because the Inception network is fully convolutional, each weight value corresponds to a product operation each time it is activated. \n",

Of course, the 5x5 convolution kernel can obtain more correlations between the information and activation units in the previous network, but under the premise of huge consumption of computing resources, a physical reduction in the size of the convolution kernel still appears. \n",

    "However, we still want to know whether a 5x5 convolutional layer can be replaced by a multi-layer convolutional layer with fewer parameters when the input and output sizes are consistent .

For example, using the [3x1 + 1x3] convolution layer. In this case, a single 3x3 convolution has the same receptive field. Refer to Figure 3. This asymmetric method can save [((3x3)-(3 + 3)) / (3x3) = 33%] computing resources, and replacing two 2x2 only saves [11%] Computing resources.\n",

The original motive is to pass the gradient back to the previous convolutional layer , so that they can effectively and improve the aggregation of features and avoid the problem of vanishing gradients.\n",

    "Traditionally, pooling layers are used in convolutional networks to reduce the size of feature maps . In order to avoid bottlenecks in the expression of spatial information, the number of convolution kernels in the network can be expanded before using max pooling or average pooling. \n",

    "For example, for a dxd network layer with K feature maps, to generate a network layer with 2K [d / 2 xd / 2] feature maps, we can use 2K convolution kernels with a step size of 1. Convolution and then add a pooling layer to get it, then this operation requires [2d 2 K 2 ]. But using pooling instead of convolution, the approximate operation is [2 * (d / 2) 2 xK 2 ], which reduces the operation by four times. However, this will cause a description bottleneck, because the feature map is reduced to [(d / 2) 2 xK], which will definitely cause the loss of spatial information on the network. Refer to Figure 9. However, we have adopted a different method to avoid this bottleneck, refer to Figure 10. That is, two parallel channels are used , one is a pooling layer (max or average), the step size is 2, and the other is a convolution layer , and then it is concatenated during output.\n",

And this article finds that if the convolution sum is very high, even a learning rate of 0.00001 cannot solve this training instability problem, and the high learning rate will also destroy the effect.

    "**The problem caused by increasing depth**\n",
    "\n",
    "* The first problem brought by increasing depth is the problem of gradient explosion / dissipation . This is because as the number of layers increases, the gradient of backpropagation in the network will become unstable with continuous multiplication, and become particularly large or special. small. Among them , the problem of gradient dissipation often occurs .\n",
    "\n",
    "* In order to overcome gradient dissipation, many solutions have been devised, such as using BatchNorm, replacing the activation function with ReLu, using Xaiver initialization, etc. It can be said that gradient dissipation has been well solved\n",
    "\n",
    "* Another problem of increasing depth is the problem of network degradation, that is, as the depth increases, the performance of the network will become worse and worse, which is directly reflected in the decrease in accuracy on the training set. The residual network article solves this problem. And after this problem is solved, the depth of the network has increased by several orders of magnitude.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Degradation of deep network**\n",
    "\n",
    ">With network depth increasing, accuracy gets saturated (which might be unsurprising) and then degrades rapidly. Unexpectedly, such degradation is not caused by overfitting, and adding more layers to a favored deep model leads to higher training error.\n",
    "\n",
    "![residual](img/deg.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "* The above figure is the error rate of the training set classified by the network on the CIFAR10-data set with the increase of the network depth . It can be seen that if we directly stack the convolutional layers, as the number of layers increases, the error rate increases significantly. The trend is that the deepest 56-layer network has the worst accuracy . We verified it on the VGG network. For the CIFAR-10 dataset, it took 5 minutes on the 18-layer VGG network to get the full network training. The 80% accuracy rate was achieved, and the 34-layer VGG model took 8 minutes to get the 72% accuracy rate. The problem of network degradation does exist.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The decrease in the training set error rate indicates that the problem of degradation is not caused by overfitting. The specific reason is that it is left for further study. The author's other paper \"Identity Mappings in Deep Residual Networks\" proved the occurrence of degradation. It is because the optimization performance is not good, which indicates that the deeper the network, the more difficult the reverse gradient is to conduct.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Deep Residual Networks\n",
    "\n",
    "**From 10 to 100 layers**\n",
    "\n",
    "We can imagine that *when we simply stack the network directly to a particularly long length, the internal characteristics of the network have reached the best situation in one of the layers. At this time, the remaining layers should not make any changes to the characteristics and learn automatically. The form of identity mapping*. That is to say, for a particularly deep deep network, the solution space of the shallow form of the network should be a subset of the solution space of the deep network, in other words, a network deeper than the shallow network will not have at least Worse effect, but this is not true because of network degradation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, we settle for the second best. In the case of network degradation, if we do not add depth, we can improve the accuracy. Can we at least make the deep network achieve the same performance as the shallow network, that is, let the layers behind the deep network achieve at least The role of identity mapping . Based on this idea, the author proposes a residual module to help the network achieve identity mapping.\n",
    "\n",
    "`To understand ResNet, we must first understand what kind of problems will occur when the network becomes deeper.` \n",
    "\n",
    "**The first problem brought by increasing the network depth is the disappearance and explosion of the gradient.**\n",
    "\n",
    "This problem was successfully solved after Szegedy proposed the **BN (Batch Normalization)** structure. The BN layer can normalize the output of each layer. The size can still be kept stable after the reverse layer transfer, and it will not be too small or too large. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Is it easy to converge after adding BN and then increasing the depth?** \n",
    "\n",
    "The answer is still **negative**. The author mentioned the second problem-**the degradation problem**: when the level reaches a certain level, the accuracy will saturate and then decline rapidly. This decline is not caused by the disappearance of the gradient. It is not caused by overfit, but because the network is so complicated that it is difficult to achieve the ideal error rate by unconstrained stocking training alone. \n",
    "\n",
    "The degradation problem is not a problem of the network structure itself, but is caused by the current insufficient training methods. The currently widely used training methods, whether it is SGD, AdaGrad, or RMSProp, cannot reach the theoretically optimal convergence result after the network depth becomes larger. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can also prove that as long as there is an ideal training method, deeper networks will definitely perform better than shallow networks. \n",
    "\n",
    "*The proof process is also very simple*: `Suppose that several layers are added behind a network A to form a new network B. If the added level is just an identity mapping of the output of A, that is, the output of A is after the level of B becomes the output of B, there is no change, so the error rates of network A and network B are equal, which proves that the deepened network will not be worse than the network before deepening.`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "He Kaiming proposed a residual structure to implement the above identity mapping (Below Figure): In addition to the normal convolution layer output, the entire module has a branch directly connecting the input to the output. The output and the output of the convolution do The final output is obtained by arithmetic addition. The formula is H (x) = F (x) + x, x is the input, F (x) is the output of the convolution branch, and H (x) is the output of the entire structure. It can be shown that if all parameters in the F (x) branch are 0, H (x) is an identity mapping. The residual structure artificially creates an identity map, which can make the entire structure converge in the direction of the identity map, ensuring that the final error rate will not become worse because the depth becomes larger. If a network can achieve the desired result by simply setting the parameter values by hand, then this structure can easily converge to the result through training. This is a rule that is unsuccessful when designing complex networks. Recall that in order to restore the original distribution after BN processing, the formula y = rx + delta is used. When r is manually set to standard deviation and delta is the mean, y is the distribution before BN processing. This is the use of this Rules.\n",

    "\n",

    "#### What does residual learning mean?\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea of residual learning is the above picture, which can be understood as a block, defined as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "![residual](img/resnet11.gif)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The residual learning block contains two branches or two mappings:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Identity mapping refers to the curved curve on the right side of the figure above. As its name implies, identity mapping refers to its own mapping, which is x itself;\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. *F*(x) Residual mapping refers to another branch, that is, part. This part is called residual mapping (y -x) .\n",
    "\n",
    "**What role does the residual module play in back propagation?**\n",
    "\n",
    "* The residual module will significantly reduce the parameter value in the module, so that the parameters in the network have a more sensitive response ability to the loss of reverse conduction, although the fundamental It does not solve the problem that the loss of backhaul is too small, but it reduces the parameters. Relatively speaking, it increases the effect of backhaul loss and also generates a certain regularization effect.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Secondly, because there are branches of the identity mapping in the forward process, the gradient conduction in the back-propagation process also has more simple paths , and the gradient can be transmitted to the previous module after only one relu.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The so-called backpropagation is that the network outputs a value, and then compares it with the real value to an error loss. At the same time, the loss is changed to change the parameter. The returned loss depends on the original loss and gradient. Since the purpose is to change the parameter, The problem is that if the intensity of changing the parameter is too small, the value of the parameter can be reduced, so that the loss of the intensity of changing the parameter is relatively greater.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Therefore, the most important role of the residual module is to change the way of forward and backward information transmission, thereby greatly promoting the optimization of the network.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Using the four criteria proposed by Inceptionv3, we will use them again to improve the residual module. Using criterion 3, the dimensionality reduction before spatial aggregation will not cause information loss, so the same method is also used here, adding 1 * 1 convolution The kernel is used to increase the non-linearity and reduce the depth of the output to reduce the computational cost. You get the form of a residual module that becomes a bottleneck. The figure above shows the basic form on the left and the bottleneck form on the right.\n",
    "\n",
    "* To sum up, the shortcut module will help the features in the network perform identity mapping in the forward process, and help conduct gradients in the reverse process, so that deeper models can be successfully trained.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why can the residual learning solve the problem of \"the accuracy of the network deepening declines\"?\n",
    "\n",
    "For a neural network model, if the model is optimal, then training can easily optimize the residual mapping to 0, and only identity mapping is left at this time. No matter how you increase the depth, the network will always be in an optimal state in theory. Because it is equivalent to all the subsequent added networks to carry information transmission along the identity mapping (self), it can be understood that the number of layers behind the optimal network is discarded (without the ability to extract features), and it does not actually play a role. . In this way, the performance of the network will not decrease with increasing depth.\n",

    "The author used two types of data, **ImageNet** and **CIFAR**, to prove the effectiveness of ResNet:\n",
    "\n",
    "The first is ImageNet. The authors compared the training effect of ResNet structure and traditional structure with the same number of layers. The left side of Figure is a VGG-19 network with a traditional structure (each followed by BN), the middle is a 34-layer network with a traditional structure (each followed by BN), and the right side is 34 layers ResNet (the solid line indicates a direct connection, and the dashed line indicates a dimensional change using 1x1 convolution to match the number of features of the input and output). Figure 3 shows the results after training these types of networks. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The data on the left shows that the 34-layer network (red line) with the traditional structure has a higher error rate than the VGG-19 (blue-green line). Because the BN structure is added to each layer Therefore, the high error is not caused by the gradient disappearing after the level is increased, but by the degradation problem; the ResNet structure on the right side of Figure 3 shows that the 34-layer network (red line) has a higher error rate than the 18-layer network (blue-green line). Low, this is because the ResNet structure has overcome the degradation problem. In addition, the final error rate of the ResNet 18-layer network on the right is similar to the error rate of the traditional 18-layer network on the left. This is because the 18-layer network is simpler and can converge to a more ideal result even without the ResNet structure.\n",

    "\n",
    "The ResNet structure like the left side of Fig. 4 is only used for shallow ResNet networks. If there are many network layers, the dimensions near the output end of the network will be very large. Still using the structure on the left side of Fig. 4 will cause a huge amount of calculation. For deeper networks, we all use the bottleneck structure on the right side of Figure 4, first using a 1x1 convolution for dimensionality reduction, then 3x3 convolution, and finally using 1x1 dimensionality to restore the original dimension.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, considering the cost of the calculation, the residual block is calculated and optimized, that is, the two 3x3 convolution layers are replaced with 1x1 + 3x3 + 1x1 , as shown below. The middle 3x3 convolutional layer in the new structure first reduces the calculation under one dimensionality-reduced 1x1 convolutional layer , and then restores it under another 1x1 convolutional layer , both maintaining accuracy and reducing the amount of calculation .\n",
    "\n",
    "![residual](img/variant.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This is equivalent to reducing the amount of parameters for the same number of layers , so it can be extended to deeper models. So the author proposed ResNet with 50, 101 , and 152 layers , and not only did not have degradation problems, the error rate was greatly reduced, and the computational complexity was also kept at a very low level .\n",
    "\n",
    "At this time, the error rate of ResNet has already dropped other networks a few streets, but it does not seem to be satisfied. Therefore, a more abnormal 1202 layer network has been built. For such a deep network, optimization is still not difficult, but it appears The problem of overfitting is quite normal. The author also said that the 1202 layer model will be further improved in the future.\n",
