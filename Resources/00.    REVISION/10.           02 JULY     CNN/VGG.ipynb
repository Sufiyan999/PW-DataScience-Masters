    ">The full name of VGG is the Visual Geometry Group, which belongs to the Department of Science and Engineering of Oxford University. It has released a series of convolutional network models beginning with VGG, which can be applied to face recognition and image classification, from VGG16 to VGG19. The original purpose of VGG's research on the depth of convolutional networks is to understand how the depth of convolutional networks affects the accuracy and accuracy of large-scale image classification and recognition. -Deep-16 CNN), in order to deepen the number of network layers and to avoid too many parameters, a small 3x3 convolution kernel is used in all layers.\n"

    ">The input of VGG is set to an RGB image of 224x244 size. The average RGB value is calculated for all images on the training set image, and then the image is input as an input to the VGG convolution network. A 3x3 or 1x1 filter is used, and the convolution step is fixed. . There are 3 VGG fully connected layers, which can vary from VGG11 to VGG19 according to the total number of convolutional layers + fully connected layers. The minimum VGG11 has 8 convolutional layers and 3 fully connected layers. The maximum VGG19 has 16 convolutional layers. +3 fully connected layers. In addition, the VGG network is not followed by a pooling layer behind each convolutional layer, or a total of 5 pooling layers distributed under different convolutional layers.

The overall structure includes 5 sets of convolutional layers, followed by a MaxPool. The difference is that more and more cascaded convolutional layers are included in the five sets of convolutional layers .\n",

    "> Each convolutional layer in AlexNet contains only one convolution, and the size of the convolution kernel is 7 * 7 ,. In VGGNet, each convolution layer contains 2 to 4 convolution operations. The size of the convolution kernel is 3 * 3, the convolution step size is 1, the pooling kernel is 2 * 2, and the step size is 2. The most obvious improvement of VGGNet is to reduce the size of the convolution kernel and increase the number of convolution layers.\n",

The advantages of using three 3 * 3 convolutions instead of one 7 * 7 convolution are twofold : one, including three ReLu layers instead of one , makes the decision function more discriminative; and two, reducing parameters . For example, the input and output are all C channels. 3 convolutional layers using 3 * 3 require 3 (3 * 3 * C * C) = 27 * C * C, and 1 convolutional layer using 7 * 7 requires 7 * 7 * C * C = 49C * C. This can be seen as applying a kind of regularization to the 7 * 7 convolution, so that it is decomposed into three 3 * 3 convolutions.\n",
